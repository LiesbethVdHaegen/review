# Minutes
## Status collaboration agreements
There are 2 collaboration agreements that were discussed:
-  the collaboration agreement around the data standardization exercise "Building"
-  the collaboration agreement around the data standardization budget for 2022

Both agreements have been approved by Legal of BOSA and have been returned to Flanders for signing. After that BOSA will sign and then the other parties.

## Start of ICEG buildings
Interested parties are in the first place the members of the workgroup "Building Unit (BUNI)". Also business experts regarding "Parcels" and "Taxation" should be invited. The exercise is also open for other parties (e.g. notories, ..).
PWC will prepare the initiation of the exercise (invitation, collection of data, ..).

Timing: starting in March which means invitations should be sent by end of January; target September for finalizing. Results to be proposed to the ICEG committee before end of year.

## New in 2022:  presentation project charter on emergency services
The NGI presented the case for the "Uniform and shared catography for emergency services" (see attached presentation and project charter). The emergency services are very interested in this case which aims at standardizing all data related with hydrants. For the moment this data is very dispersed, non standardized and sometimes only available on paper.

The ICEG review committee thinks the presented case falls in the scope of an ICEG standardization effort and will present it to the ICEG committee for approval.
Target for starting the exercise would be April.

## New in 2022:   presentation SDG case on address change / move
Talks are ongoing between Flanders, BOSA and the SDG coordination team to prepare a project charter for a standardization exercise that would focus on a well chosen SDG-procedure (e.g. address change). The approach followed by OSLO Steps would be included for elaborating the detailed process.
The exercise would then also focus on aspects that would be generic and reusable for other complex processes. A project charter would be expected in the coming 2 weeks. 

## Finalization publication "Public services and public organisations" 
By end of January the following deliverables would be published on www.belgif.be : SHACL, JSON-LD and RDFS. 

PWC will put all material on github; Bart will integrate this material on http://vocab.belgif.be .
In a later phase Bart will try to align with a mor ehuman friendly publication on belgif (source of inspiration: https://data.vlaanderen.be/standaarden/erkende-standaard/applicatieprofiel-bedrijventerrein.html)

PWC will also prepare a notification mail for the ICEG committee with respect to this new standard.

## Training 2022
Workshop on ICEG Public Services and Public Organisations.
Timing: March 29th, 2022 (9.30 â€“ 11.00).

Raf wil set up a preparation meeting. Rink is interested in participating.

## Next meeting of the ICEG review committee
Still to be determined. To be aligned with the next ICEG committee meeting (e.g. 3 weeks before that meeting)
