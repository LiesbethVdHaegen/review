## Notes

### Topic: Thematic on URI's for organizations
The review committee decides to work in 2 phases:
- phase 1: discuss with KBO (without budget); goal is to define official URI's for organizations and business units of organizations (this includes domain management); a meeting needs to be organized with a decision taker at KBO
- phase 2: here the approach for defining URI's for departments within organizations or business units will be discussed (with budget); timing wise, phase 2 will take place after the thematic on Education

### Topic: Thematic on Education
The budget for which a decision in principle by the ICEG committee was obtained, will come from BOSA and the 3 communities (Flanders, French speaking community, German speaking community). The proposal made by Flanders needs to be adapted in this way.
Before hiring the needed consultants, each of these 4 parties needs to confirm their agreement with this proposal to Flanders (preferrably by end of March). After this agreement, it will take an additional 3 to 4 weeks before the thematic can really start.

### Topic: Trainings
